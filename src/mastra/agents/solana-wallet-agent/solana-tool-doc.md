## üîë Session Code vs Private Key: How Do I Use Them?

- **Session Code**: Like a secret nickname for your wallet. Register your private key with a code once, then use just the code for future actions. Safer and easier!
- **Private Key**: The direct way. Provide your private key every time (not recommended for regular use).
- **Both**: If you provide both, the tool will store your private key under the session code for next time.
- **Register Action**: Use the `register` action to save your private key with a session code for future use. After that, just use your code!

**Pro Tip:**
> Register your session once, then use your code for all future sends and schedules. No need to share your private key again!

## üí¨ Example Prompts (Just Talk to Your Agent!)

### Register a Session
> "I want to register my Solana wallet for future use. Here is my private key: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]. Use the code 'my-session-123' to save it."

### Send SOL Immediately
> "Send 0.1 SOL to this address: [RECIPIENT_ADDRESS]. Use my session code 'my-session-123'."

or, if you want to provide the private key directly:
> "Send 0.1 SOL to [RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] using this private key: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]."

### Schedule a SOL Transfer
> "Schedule a transfer of 0.2 SOL to [RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] at July 3, 2025, 7:00 AM UTC+1 using my session code 'my-session-123'."

or, with private key:
> "Schedule 0.2 SOL to [RECIPIENT_ADDRESS] on 2024-07-01T15:00:00Z using this private key: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]."

**Replace `[YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]` and `[RECIPIENT_ADDRESS]` with your actual values.**
